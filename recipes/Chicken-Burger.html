    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This shredded chicken sandwich is great when you don't have
         a ton of ingredients laying around to make an elaborate meal.
         Experiment with the seasoning measurements. No matter what, 
         I find it turns out delicious. Simple, tasty, and filling--and
         great for leftovers!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lime juice</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 pinch garlic salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch onion powder, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch poultry seasoning, or to taste</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1Â½ cups BBQ sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup salsa</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise, or to taste</li>
        <li>4 (2 ounce) hamburger buns</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put chicken into a pot and fill water to cover by 1 inch. Add lime juice, bay leaf, garlic salt, onion powder, poultry seasoning, and pepper; bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat, partially cover, and simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 8 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>While chicken is cooking, combine BBQ sauce, salsa, and cayenne in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Remove cooked chicken from the pot and shred with 2 forks. Mix shredded chicken into the BBQ sauce mixture until fully covered.</li>
        <li>Put a little mayo on each hamburger bun and pile the shredded chicken mixture on top.</li>
    </ol>
